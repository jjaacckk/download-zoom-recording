# download Zoom recording

## a userscript that adds a "Download Recording" link to all Zoom recording webpages.

often when a host shares a Zoom recording link with you, there is no simple way to download the recording. So, this script will add an <a> tag to any Zoom recording webpage so that you can easily download the video.
  
to use this, just add the JS code to your preferred userscript plugin (i use [UserScripts for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887?mt=12)).
